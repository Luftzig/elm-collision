# Elm Collision

Detect collision/intersection of geometry in a defined coordinate space, AKA: tell me when objects are touching or overlapping

This library is useful for games, interactive apps, dynamic element composition and other cases where you need efficient detection of overlapping objects

Right now this library supports a small set of 2D operations, but the intent is to keep a powerful set of 2D and 3D operations while maintaining a focused and clear API


### Get Started

- Read the [the documentation][docs].
- Look and try [the examples][examples].
