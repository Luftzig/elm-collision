Current implementation note: this algorithm is very efficient but
has some issues handling corner to corner collision, I'm planning on a
way to solve this on a next release. Right now just know that
corner to corner collision may not get reported at all

    Calculate which side of a rectangle is colliding w/ another, it works by
    getting the Minkowski sum of rect2 and rect1, then checking where the centre of
    rect1 lies relatively to the new rectangle (from Minkowski) and to its diagonals
